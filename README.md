The Searchify application is used for searching for songs in the Spotify resources and preparing summaries for them. The summary is displayed in the form of statistics and photos associated with the given track. In the summary panel, clicking on the blue link representing the recommended track will take you to the summary of the clicked song. The application retrieves the name of the song from the user, and then searches the Spotify resources to find its ID, artist ID, and album, based on which the summary is created. In case the user is not satisfied with the search results in the search panel, there is an option to provide the artist of the given song, which increases the search engine's effectiveness.
